I'm also a 5th and 6th grade teacher up here in Loveland, CO, and a father of four little ones, so life is exciting : ) I'm looking for someone who can spend probably 5-10 hours a week helping us with our SEO efforts, although more time more be needed initially.

The way I see it, there are four main categories we should be focusing on here. The first is SEO specialist: someone who will collaborate with us to find the right keywords/phrases for us to go after. Second is web developer: someone who will modify our website to be search engine friendly and help with the creation of new pages. Third is web producer: someone who formulates a plan to increase our online user experience and conversion rate. Fourth is content writer: someone to make keyword-rich blog content for our website that people are actually excited to find. This is the area I'm most focused on. For real success, I believe it's vital that we have amazing content. I would like to add to hire someone for each of these areas and have us all collaborate as a team.

Please understand that I just put a price on the ad because I had to, but I have no idea what that should be. Obviously, cost is a major consideration, especially with the current situation, but I also want to make sure you are adequately compensated for top quality work that produces results. I'm very excited about executing this. You will find I'm extremely passionate about what I do, and I truly believe we can start crushing it online with your help.

If you think this is the right fit for you, please include a cover letter with your resume. To be clear, you will not be considered if this isn't included. I find this vetting process always me to get to know you better and weeds out most of the people who aren't truly interested.

Would you agree those are the four main areas I should focus on, or am I way off on that? Finally, please include a couple references for me to contact and/or some way for me to view your work.

At Seer, we pride ourselves on innovation; standing out among the rest and enabling our clients to do the same. We strive to live into our motto of ‘Stop Guessing’ by leveraging big data to drive holistic digital marketing strategy. We get excited at the thought of bringing together millions of data points from disparate data sets, including qualitative data to drive empathy-fueled opportunities and insights. Big Data, automation, and problem solving at scale: it's what's for breakfast. Could this be love? Maybe.


What about you? You’re a natural-born consultant and will spend your days creating digital marketing strategies that tie into clients’ overall marketing plans. You are passionately engaged with the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape, and have a finger on the changes that can help drive client success. You’re intellectually curious, not afraid to think big and build innovative client strategies—Oh, and you have an affinity for anticipating client needs before they even have to ask, too.
Here are some highlights of what you'll be doing...
You’ll work closely with a handful of clients, researching far beyond the SEO landscape to understand their specific challenges. With that knowledge, you’ll execute strategies designed to solve a problem for a very specific audience
You understand that at the end of the day, your client's’ ultimate goal is to drive organic traffic to their site and increase their ROI—to do this, you’ll work closely with clients to develop innovative assets after conducting in-depth content gap analyses, competitive & audience analysis, keyword research, and SERP landscape analysis
You’re a whiz when it comes to making data & results digestible and you’ll share campaign success as it relates to your clients’ goals on a monthly basis using various analytics platforms like Google Analytics and Adobe SiteCatalyst
You understand that other channels play a role in the SEO process, so you’ll often partner with the PPC, Analytics, Content and Design teams to solve client needs
The skills you'll bring to the table...
Experience building and driving SEO strategy across multiple industries is an absolute must, but your ability to tie outcomes to campaign goals and measure impact is what gives you an edge
SEO is your thing, but you're confident using Analytics to make data-driven decisions—You understand that Content Strategy is really about providing resources to solve users’ problems
When questions or challenges present themselves, you don’t sweat it for a second; you’re extremely comfortable interfacing with clients and driving conversations
There’s always a method (and some data) behind our madness! Because of that, critical and strategic thinking skills are a must
We move fast and you’ll be juggling lots of priorities. You’ll need solid project management skills to get the job done. You’re comfortable managing your own deadlines and when things get a little crazy, you’re okay with asking for help
Things change quickly in the digital space and your ability to measure strategy effectiveness (changes to rankings, traffic, conversions) and make decisions based on that data is killer. Your clients love you for it
You’re passionate about staying “in-the-know” on SEO trends
Bonus Points
Have your own website or blog? We’d love to see it.
Worked in a fast-paced, digital agency? Awesome.
Created awesome content for specific audience personas? Sweet!

As an SEO Analyst, you walk a tightrope between analysis and creativity. You’re fluent in the Google best practices and stellar user experience, working to drive local visibility for small businesses. You’re curious, excited to test new ideas, and see algorithm updates as a challenge and an opportunity to propel our clients above their competition.


What You Bring to the Table:


Coalmarch is looking for a candidate who is passionate about the future of digital marketing and interested in the bigger picture of how search strategy can impact local businesses. You will be a foundational player in managing the overall SEO strategy for our home service industry clients, developing new ways to turn internet traffic into qualified leads.

You must have 1-2 years of experience in a digital marketing role and foundational knowledge of digital marketing principles (including search engine optimization and pay-per-click advertising).

An ideal candidate will know their way around tools like Moz, Google Search Console, Screaming Frog, Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager.

As an SEO Analyst, you will:
Develop, manage, and implement SEO strategies for small business clients, including local listing management, review generation, on-page, and off-page optimization.
Develop highly optimized content and link building campaigns to improve the relevance and authority of our clients and advance their organic visibility.

Who is Coalmarch?


Coalmarch is a digital marketing agency based in Raleigh, focused on providing small business owners in the home services industries (lawn care, pest control, & HVAC) with the tools they need to grow.

We create a central, CMS-based platform and responsive website to drive traffic and conversion. Using on-page optimization, technical SEO, content creation, PPC, and other local search strategies, we drive visibility and lead generation for small businesses across the country.

We’re small but mighty - which is the perfect environment if you’re the kind of person who likes to make a visible difference on the team.

At Coalmarch, you’ll be encouraged to discover and hone your strengths and passions.

(We’re passionate about marketing, technology, design, research, and strategy that helps our small business clients grow - so if you’re passionate about those things, too, we’re going to get along great!)

We have the fast-paced work environment of an agency without the 80-hour weeks. (In fact, our workweek ends at 38 hours!) You can leave the suit and tie at home - every day is Casual Friday.

It’s not unusual to find coworkers snuggling with office dogs or grabbing a beer at Happy Hour together, and once a month, we all call it quits a few hours early to compete in a skee-ball tournament at Boxcar, catch a movie, or volunteer our time at the soup kitchen or Habitat for Humanity.

Maybe let someone else handle the sales, reporting, billing, and other administrative chores so you can focus on the creative marketing part you love? How about collaborating with other specialists so you can take on larger and more challenging projects?

Let’s team up!

We’re CanIRank, a 100% distributed digital marketing agency with a unique model that combines the best of machine learning-based software and a team of dynamic specialists working from home to collaborate on interesting and challenging client projects without the overhead of a traditional agency.

As our new Digital Marketing Associate, you’ll join our 22-person strong team of specialists in SEO, content marketing, SEM / PPC, social media, PR, technical, and design. Our clients are primarily SaaS, startup, and ecommerce businesses, and they rely on us to come up with creative, attention-getting content campaigns that will help them compete against Mega Brands currently dominating the search engine results.

A typical day's work might include tasks such as pitching a journalist, relationship building with industry bloggers, optimizing a new product page for both conversions and search engine rankings, debugging a Wordpress duplicate content issue, or revising a client website's information architecture.

Yep, that's a lot! We're big on continuous improvement here at CanIRank, so you can expect to sharpen your skillset through our 6-week Onboarding Program, Biweekly Trainings, and Team Huddles, as well as be asked to share knowledge of your own.

With experience and expertise you’ll have the opportunity to take the lead developing the overall marketing strategy for a client and leading other consultants in its execution.

We’re primarily looking for remote freelancers to help out on an as-needed basis. However, if the fit is good we can also hire for PT or FT employee roles including a full benefits package (subsidized health insurance, unlimited PTO, tech stipend, learning stipend, flex time). Depending on the task and your skill level, freelancer rates range from $18 - 26 / hr or $25 - $300 / task. Perks include regular paid training, culture events, performance bonuses, and the opportunity to work with (and learn from) some pretty badass digital marketers!

Although our team is distributed throughout the US, we’re looking to build up a talent pool in the Central Oregon region with an eye towards opening a Bend office in the future.

ABOUT YOU
1-5 years professional work experience, or internships of extraordinary relevance and quality
Exceptional persuasive writing ability: your college application essay made the Dean cry, and your status updates win more “likes” than a skateboarding puppy doing the Harlem Shake.
Citizen Web: you have a strong affinity for internet culture, spend time contributing and sharing online, and may even have dabbled in Wordpress, HTML, web design, or coding.
Startup compatibility: you're comfortable with changing roles, blistering speed, and figuring it out as you go along
Passion for helping small businesses succeed
Self-disciplined: you prefer to structure your own tasks, all the better to try out that new hyper-productivity system you read about last weekend
Virtually extraverted: it's OK if you're shy at parties, but on the internet you're not afraid to speak up, always remembering that there's a real person on the other side of your monitor, and connecting in an authentic manner whether you're pitching a TechCrunch writer or helping Milfred find a new web host for her gluten free dog biscuit store.
DEFINITELY APPLY IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ALSO APPLY TO YOU:
You regularly contribute to Tier 1 online or print publications
Experience in a startup or SME-focused PR, SEO, or Content Marketing Agency
Prior success generating exceptional ROI on AdWords campaigns

Wirecutter helps people buy the right things for the way they want to live. The site was founded by journalists in September 2011 and was acquired by The New York Times Company in October 2016. Our recommendations are made through vigorous reporting, interviewing, and testing by teams of veteran journalists, scientists, and researchers. Consider us a best-of list for everyday things; a curated gallery filled with only interesting, useful objects; a thank-you note to the designers and engineers who create the stuff that makes our lives better; a geeky friend with next-level research skills who tests everything they buy so you don’t have to. The point is to make buying great gear quickly easier so you can get on with living your life.

Our Company Principles:

Our principles help us create a work environment that breeds trust, respect, learning and is one that we all are excited about showing up to each day.

Seek Understanding: We are lifelong students who want to understand the world around us. We are curious to understand our readers, how we get better at our own disciplines and how we can work better together. This means we are active listeners, information hunters and empathetic.

Explain Why: Because we seek to understand, we value the importance of explaining our ideas and our understanding. This means we are constructively candid, sharing our perspectives and the thought process behind it. And then learning from the conversation that ensues. We are all teachers and students, helping each other grow.

Solve Things: We love to solve things, whether they are our own problems, our readers problems or our colleagues problems. While we often can solve problems on our own, we believe our best results come out when we solve them together.

Get It Done: We are passionate about getting things done. Whether it is our own individual work or teamwork, our instinct is to forge a path forward and learn as we go. This means we continually focus on how to turn work into achievable chunks, communicate those effectively to the team and efficiently execute against them.

Make It Better: We aren’t satisfied with perpetuating the status quo. We’re always looking forward. We live to change the world around us for the better, making a difference in our own lives and our readers’ lives. If we are being ambitious enough, this means that we will both fail and succeed and we take pride in owning both of those outcomes as long as we are learning.

Do you work for a digital marketing agency? Are you great at your job, but just getting tired of the high stress and active pace needed to take care of a large multiple client load?

Wow, just think of what you could do…

This may just be the job for you…

There is a rare opportunity at OuterBox for an extremely talented individual to focus on just that one client - to bring all of their skills and all their experience to bear in a concentrated, scientific way that will produce the highest ROI for that client.

What's In It For You


If you've made it to this point in reading this post, then you are probably already thinking, “this is all great, but what's in it for me?”

At Arteric, you will work side-by-side with our incredibly seasoned and talented developers to identify new and unique ways to apply data science and machine learning to SEO challenges. For example, we have used AI technology to build proprietary tools to help inform our SEO work. One tool uses machine learning and natural language processing to identify signals hidden in hundreds of thousands of user interactions. Another tool analyzes competitors' content vs our client's website to assess relative power and authority across topics.

With those same teams, you will work to identify best practices for technical SEO that can be standardized into Arteric's technology-development process. This will allow you to expand your SEO skills with advanced analytics techniques in a one-of-a-kind way.

To work 40 hours and not need to check your email from the top of Bierstadt, or on the drive back to Denver. To be surrounded by talented people with multiple superpowers.
