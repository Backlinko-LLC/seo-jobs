# Internal Comments & Questions



# 0. Data

We use two data sets:

* Glassdoor data (original) with 908 observations
* LinkedIn data (original) with 62,095 observations
  - subset for "SEO": with 2,387 observations
  - subset for "SEO" and English-speaking offers: with 603 observations

The LinkedIn data contain global job offers while the GlassDoor data only jobs from the US. The LinkedIn data including only job offers with the term `SEO` (or `seo`) contain 2,387 (27,869 for all job offers) observations from English-speaking countries (USA, Canada, UK, Australia, Ireland, South Africa) and 552 (23,81727,869 for all job offers) from the USA and the UK (links starting with `www.linkedin.com`).

We merged both data sets and kept as many variables as possible, manually creating new variables for both datasets (GlassDoor: `seniority` and `employment type`; LinkedIn: `sector`) based on text matching of job titles and descriptions. The final worldwide data set contains 3,295 observations (63,003 for all job offers).

Because the job offers are collected from all over the world, a lot of foreign terms are included. Thus, we merged the GlassDoor data also with the English subset of the LinkedIn data and kept again as many variables as possible by manually creating new variables for both data sets. The final "All English" data set contains 1,511 observations (28,777 for all job offers).

The GlassDoor data are cleaner with regard to job titles and description than the LinkedIn data. Consequently, some plots using the GlassDoor data do a better job so we provide for now both version (the merged All English data set and the GlassDoor data set).

Also, the GlassDoor data contain information that are missing from the LinkedIn data such as `estimated salary range`, `rating`, `employer`, `industry`, and `size (no. of employees)`.




# 1. Job Title

## 1.1 Most Popular SEO Jobs

### Which words are the most popular in the job title?

We analyzed the data on job titles using text mining techniques. In a first step, we tokenize the job titles into single words and visualize their frequency. Stop words and words that appeared less than 7 times were removed to make the graph easier to grasp.


![](../plots/png/1_1_jobs_word_1.png)



### Which consecutive term sequences are the most popular in the job title?

In a second step, we analyzed sequences of words in the job title. The sorted bar plot shows the most popular consecutive sequences of words (5 or more occurrences), colored by category.


![](../plots/png/1_1_jobs_cat_1.png)



### Are technical terms in job titles more popular? Which technical and non-technical terms are most popular?

We  manually classified in technical and non-technical positions, removing all words that are no specific to any of the both categories:

* technical ~  `analy|special|engine|develop|technic|optimi`
* non-technical ~  `manage|direct|writ|consult|coordinat|edito|market|sale|social|strateg|supervis`

The modified stacked bar plot shows the number of words found per job category and, additionally as another stacked bar next to it, the most common words per category (with labels for words that occured at least 20 times). The height of the stacks indicates as well the number, the width is arbitrary.

# 2. Location

## 2.1 Hot Spots: Cities (Bubble Map)

### Hexagonal Tile Map

## 2.3 Hot Spots by US Counties

# 3. Company Info

## 3.1	Size

#### How large are companies that hire?

![](../plots/png/3_1_size_histo_1.png)

#### (Do larger companies require more specialized tasks?)

--> ??? What do we define as "more specialized tasks"?


#### (Do larger companies require a formal education?)

We extracted from the job descriptiosn the required/desired degree:

* Bachelors ~ `B.Ba.|B.Sc.|BBa|BSc|BBA|BSC|Bachelors`
* Masters ~ `M.Ba.|M.Sc.|MBa|MSc|MBA|MSC|Masters`
* Doctorates ~ `Ph.D.|PhD|Doctorate`

![](../plots/png/3_1_size_edu_1.png)

In total we found 39 posisition mentioning Bachelors, 10 Masters and only one with Doctorate.


## 3.2	Revenue

#### Which education level is required by high-revenue companies?

-> I've added this since it's a low hanging fruit after the last section ;)
-> 3 different versiomn to deal with poverplotting of the x-axis labels

![](../plots/png/3_2_revenue_edu_small_1.png)

![](../plots/png/3_2_revenue_edu_dodge_1.png)

![](../plots/png/3_2_revenue_edu_angle_1.png)


#### (What type of skill sets are required by high-revenue companies?)

--> ??? Can you come up with a list or should I try to extract common words? Don't know yet how to determine those terms between skills and... yeah, what does mark the end of the skill section?

--> So I tokenized the description and removed stop words and numbers as well as manually non-sense/non-skill-related words. There might be more but if we keep it we can have a closer look I would say. Only later realized it has less priority. However, these wordclouds can be used in another context for sure anyway.

## 3.3	Sector/Industry

#### Which sectors do mainly hire SEOs?

![](../plots/png/3_3_sector_counts_1.png)


#### Which industries are interested in filling SEO positions?

![](../plots/png/3_3_industry_counts_1.png)


## 3.4	Company Rating

#### (Do lower rated companies pay less (salary)?)

![](../plots/png/3_4_rating_salary_1.png)

#### (Which companies have the highest ratings?)


# 4	Job Responsibilities

!!! For section 4. and 5.: To get the words we are looking for, it would be useful to see a simple wordcloud or a df which the tokenized words (single words and bigrams). That way, we can scan through the list and select those that fit to job tasks, programming language, knowledge of popular tools, etc. What do you think? Open to other appraoches.   

Words in the job desciptions with a frequency of 10 or more:

![](../plots/png/4_cloud_word_1.png)

Consecutive sequences of words (*ngrams*) in the job desciptions with a frequency of 10 or more:

![](../plots/png/4_cloud_sequ_1.png)


## 4.1	Job related tasks

#### What job tasks are most often mentioned?


## 4.2	Deep dive into job tasks (PPC, content management, technical, etc.)

#### What technical SEO tasks are most often required?

--> How will this differ to 1.1 where we look at technical vs non-technical positions? Since I already showed the most common terms here i think it is (almost?) the same plot.


# 5	Job Requirements

## 5.1	Programming Languages

#### What programming languages are most often required?

I for now use the programming languages listed by the SO yearly survey:
JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Python, Java, Bash/Shell/PowerShell, C#, PHP, C++, TypeScript, C, Ruby, Go, Assembly, Swift, Kotlin, R, VBA, Objective-C, Scala, Rust, Dart, Elixir, Clojure, WebAssembly + Julia

![](../plots/png/5_1_require_prog_1.png)


#### What languages are most often required in combination (e.g. Html, CSS)

![](../plots/png/5_1_require_prog_comb_1.png)



## 5.2	Knowledge of Popular Tools

#### What tools are most often required?

--> What's the difference to 5.1, including i.e. Power BI? Do you provide a list of common tools?


## 5.3	Years of Experience

#### What type of SEO jobs require +5 years experience?

--> Simply filter by "5+ years"? Or search for years and extract number? How to evaluate if they use different ways to say the same?


## 5.4	Degree Requirements

#### What type of degrees are most often required (BS vs MS vs None)?

--> Did this already for company info - any other relationship of interest here? Or a simple bar plot showing the three educaiton levels summarized and not for each company size/salary?


# 6	Salaries

## 6.1	Salary Ranges

#### What are the typical salary ranges for SEO jobs?



## 6.2	Salaries per Location

#### Where do companies pay the most/least?


## 6.3	Salaries for different positions

#### What are the highest/lowest paying SEO positions?


## 6.4	Salaries per job requirements

#### Do positions with programming languages pay significantly more?
